# Overview 
The contracts are created to be upgradeable as they save all long-term data in Database.sol. As development continues and contracts change, we will use the upgrading protocol written in ContractManager.sol. For this reason the current address + abi of the contracts will be changing throughout the Alpha. 

# Getting Started 
MyBit is currently testing it's contracts on the Ropsten testnet. You can find the currently deployed contracts in the "RopstenAddress" folder. To be able to interact with the contracts you will need the contract abi which can be found in the folder "abis". 

# Access 
The MyBit platform requires users to burn MyBit tokens to interact with the smart-contracts. For the time being there are 3 stages of access.

* 1.) Ability to fund and create assets ($25)
* 2.) To be announced ($75)
* 3.) Trade on marketplace ($100)

> Note: Stages accumulate so burning tokens for stage 2 gives you access to stage 1. Burning tokens for stage 3 also gets you access to stage 2 and 1

# Usage 


* First go to the MyBit Faucet and get at least 1,000 MYB tokens  (token has 8 decimal places so in actuality 1 MYB = 100000000)

* To fund/create assets, you must burn tokens in TokenBurn.sol

* Before funding or burning tokens the current price of Ether or MyBit must be resolved in OracleHub.

* Make sure you are approving TokenBurn + OperatorEscrow to transfer tokens before calling them. 


# Current MyBit Contracts:

## Owned 
Owned.sol handles the logic behind critical authority measures on the platform. Each owner can use this contract to sign their permission for a particular critical function to be called, as long as the owners agree on the parameters of the functions. This creates a multi-signature requirement for calling these critical functions. In the case that a wallet gets compromised, the other owners will be able to remove that malicious owner from the platform and change it with a trusted address. Owners will also be able to pause/unpause the platform in case of unexpected behavior. 

## ContractManager
ContractManager.sol is where all current contracts are registered in the MyBit platform. The Database contract will not allow anybody to change the data unless the caller is registered in the ContractManager contract. To add or remove contracts from the platform a multi-sig agreement from the owners is required. As long as ContractManager is able to add new contracts, it will be upgradeable itself. 

## Database
Database.sol holds all long term data for the platform. It stores all data in mappings which can be referenced with a bytes32 key, which is produced from the sha3 hash of variable names with associated ID's and user addresses. This contract is inspired by RocketStorage's spoke and hub model, and it will be the only contract on the platform that is not upgradeable, since it holds all the data on the platform. For this reason it is written very simple and robust, only taking bytes32 keys to store values. The database contract will only accept transactions originating from one of the contracts registered in ContractManager.

## UserAccess 
UserAccess.sol handles all the logic dealing with users access levels on the platform. This contract is authorized to grant access levels once it has been called by the TokenBurn contract. Users are able to set a backup address here, which can be used in the case that they have lost access to the original address they used to burn MyBit tokens. 1 = Funding/Creating assets, 2 = Ability to stake tokens, 3 = Ability to trade shares.

## TokenBurn 
TokenBurn.sol is where users can burn MyBit tokens in order to access the platform. This will be the users first interaction with the MyBit platform since the functionality of all other contracts require that a certain number of tokens have first been burnt. The user will indicate which access level they desire, and the TokenBurn contract then transfers the required amount of MyBit tokens from the user, which if successful, will grant access to this user. The required amount of tokens are determined by the current price of MyBit in USD. This price is determined by OracleHub, which is valid for x seconds, until it must be called again. The tokens transferred into this contract are lost forever and will be considered out of supply. To burn tokens users must first get KYC approval. 

## AssetCreation 
AssetCreation.sol is where operators can start funding periods for new assets. Operators are required to lock MyBit tokens in escrow before starting a funding period for a new asset. This escrow can be retrieved by the operator once the funders decide that he has properly done his job. Owners can modify the default funding time given for asset funding periods here. Owners are also able to remove assets from the platform, which freezes ability to trade shares for that asset.

## FundingHub 
FundingHub.sol handles all functionality involved with funding newly created assets. This contract accepts Ether payments from users within the funding period of a new asset. The contract will reward the user with shares equal to the amount that they contributed. (1 wei = 1 share). If the asset successfully meets it's funding target this contract distributes the Ether to the manufacturer, token stakers and the MyBit foundation. If the funding period is a failure, users can withdraw their funded Ether. Operators can retrieve their escrowed tokens if funding period fails.  

## Asset 
Asset.sol deals with the functionality of successfully funded assets. This contract receives all income for each live asset on the platform. Assets are referenced by their ID, which is a 32 byte hash. When shares are traded on the marketplace, this contract will be called to transfer the shares to the new owner. Asset shareholders will be able to use this contract to withdraw the income generated by any asset on the platform. 

## AssetExchange 
AssetExchange.sol creates and settles all buy and sell orders for all live assets on the MyBit platform. Users can create 1 buy & 1 sell order per asset on the platform at their desired price. Once the order is picked up, the Marketplace contract calls the Asset contract and the shares are then transferred to the new owner. The Asset contract will only allow shares to be transferred when called by the Marketplace contract.  

## OracleHub
OracleHub.sol is where users can update the current USD prices. To fund assets or burn tokens, the database must know about the latest Ether to USD prices or MyBit to USD prices. This price will be required to be updated every x seconds. 

# Deploying 
> Set 3 owners when deploying Database. Any one of these owners will be authorized to deploy the rest of the contracts. All contracts that are deployed must be added to the database through ContractManager. 

## Order of deployment:

* MyBitToken(For Testing...if deployed need the address)

* Database: args=(ownerOne.address, ownerTwo.address, ownerThree.address)

* ContractManager: args=(database.address)

* InitialVariables: args=(database.address) 

* Call StartDapp() to initialize crucial variables for later contracts

* Owned: args=(database.address)

* UserAccess: args=(database.address)

* AssetCreation: args=(database.address)

* FundingHub: args=(database.address)

* Asset: args=(database.address)

* AssetExchange: args=(database.address)

* TokenBurn: args=(MyBitToken.address, database.address)

* Send sha3("DeployFinished") to ContractManager to secure further contract additions
