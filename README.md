# MyBit-Network: Contract SDK
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Network.tech.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Network.tech) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Network.tech/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Network.tech)

A software development kit for the automated machine economy.

The SDK's contain a local blockchain and smart-contracts for developers to run and deploy dapps that allow for the funding and distribution of virtual assets represented by ERC tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contracts can be combined in different ways to customize the crowdfunding and re-distribution details, or plug into a local MyBitChain to test already operating assets.

## Getting Started

## Roles
The tokenized asset management structure is made up of different actors who have specific incentives to participate in the creation and management of tokenized assets within the ecosystem. The assets are managed by the AssetManager, who receives a fee for his work and escrows tokens as collateral to investors. The tokens remain in escrow until the asset tokens returns sufficient income. The platform owners can choose how assets are governed, whether by asset token holders or designated ownership roles.  

AssetManagers interact with the AssetManagerEscrow, AssetManagerFunds and Crowdsale Generators contracts, while Investors interact with the Crowdsale and DividendTokens contracts.

#### Platform Owner(s)
The owners of the platform are in charge of deciding high level upgrades and authorization changes made in the platform. Ownership can be decided by one owner, a multi-sig, or token holders themselves.

#### Investor
The investor is any user that holds asset tokens through participating in an asset crowdsale or by means of purchasing them on an exchange.

#### AssetManager
The AssetManager is a user that initiates a crowdfunding period for an asset. After the funding period, the AssetManager is in charge of handling real world operations between the asset operator and the investors. The role of the AssetManager varies depending on the type of asset, but they are responsible for the asset operating properly if the conditions allow it. The AssetManager can put down tokens in escrow, which is at stake to get burned if the owners of the asset find negligence.

#### Operator
The operator is the producer of the asset, physical or digital. They are in charge of receiving the crowdfunding funds and producing, delivering and installing the asset. AssetManagers will deal with Operators to ensure continued functioning of the asset.


✏️ All contracts are written in [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/) version 0.4.24.
