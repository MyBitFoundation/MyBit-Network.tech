# Ecosystem

## Contracts

### AssetExchange
Buy and sell assets that have been funded using the crowdsale contracts.

### AssetGenerator
Anyone from the ecosystem can on-board an already existing asset here. The Asset Generator creates asset tokens according to the relative holdings provided by the 'owners' of the asset. These assets are not managed by the platform, but may be used on any ERC20 AssetExchange.

### PlatformFunds
PlatformFunds lets the platform owners set the platform token and platform wallet where the owner(s) receives their share of the crowdsale income.

### Staking
Staking allows an AssetManager to borrow MYB to be put up as escrow. This functionality hasn't been implemented yet.
